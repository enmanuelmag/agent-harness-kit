Instead of letting AI agents roam freely through your project with no memory, no coordination, and no audit trail, agent-harness-kit gives them a shared structure: a task backlog, a defined workflow, a persistent log of every action taken, and a health gate that must be green before any work begins.

You stay in control. The agents stay on track.

## Why this exists

If you don't know what is Agent Harness, you can check this blog post: [Introducing Agent Harness](https://aakashgupta.medium.com/2025-was-agents-2026-is-agent-harnesses-heres-why-that-changes-everything-073e9877655e).

Most AI coding tools give you a single agent with a chat window. That works for small tasks. It breaks down when:

- You want multiple specialized agents working in sequence (plan → explore → build → review)
- You need to track what changed, what was tried, and what was blocked — across sessions
- You switch between AI providers (Claude Code today, OpenCode tomorrow) and don't want to re-setup everything
- You want a health check that agents must pass before touching code

agent-harness-kit solves all of this with a thin layer of scaffolding and a local MCP server that any MCP-compatible AI tool can connect to.

---

## How it works

```
ahk init
  └── creates config, agent definitions, task backlog, health check

AI tool opens your project
  └── reads .claude/mcp.json, opencode.json, or .codex/config.toml
  └── spawns: npx ahk serve (stdio MCP server)

Agent starts working
  └── tasks.get()         → picks a task from the backlog
  └── tasks.claim(id)     → atomically claims it (no double-work)
  └── actions.start()     → registers its action
  └── actions.write()     → logs sections: result, files, blockers…
  └── actions.complete()  → closes the action

Lead → Explorer → Builder → Reviewer
  └── each role has its own agent definition with clear responsibilities
  └── the harness DB records the full history
```

Everything is stored locally in a SQLite database (`.harness/harness.db`). No cloud, no external services, no API keys required beyond what your AI tool already uses.

---

## Features

- **Provider-agnostic** — works with Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex CLI, or any MCP-compatible AI tool. Switch providers without losing your task history or reconfiguring your workflow.
- **Structured 5-agent workflow** — Lead, Explorer, Consultant, Builder, and Reviewer each have defined responsibilities and can only act within their role.
- **Atomic task claiming** — agents use `tasks.claim()` which uses a SQLite transaction to prevent two agents from picking up the same task at the same time.
- **Full audit trail** — every action, file touched, tool used, and section written is stored in SQLite and queryable.
- **Health gate** — agents must run `health.sh` and get a green exit before starting or closing any task. You define what "healthy" means.
- **Markdown fallback** — `current.md` is always regenerated so agents can understand the session state even without the MCP server.
- **Docs search** — agents can call `docs.search(query)` to find relevant content in your project's docs folder before writing code.
- **Multi-database support** — SQLite by default (zero native deps, uses `node:sqlite` on Node ≥ 22 or `bun:sqlite` on Bun). Switch to PostgreSQL or MySQL with a single config line — same schema, same MCP tools, same workflow.
- **Incremental scaffold** — `ahk init` and `ahk build` never overwrite files you've customized. Agent definitions you've edited are preserved.
- **Global installation** — `ahk init` can scaffold the harness into your home directory (`~/.claude` or `~/.config/opencode`) to share it across all projects.
- **Input validation** — CLI prompts validate all inputs (name length, path format, task title, etc.) and retry with the error message instead of silently accepting bad values.

---

## Requirements

- Node.js ≥ 22.5 **or** Bun (any recent version)
- npm ≥ 9

---

## Installation

```bash
# Install in your project as a dev dependency
npm install --save-dev @cardor/agent-harness-kit

# Or globally
npm install -g @cardor/agent-harness-kit
```

Then run the interactive setup inside your project:

```bash
npx ahk init
# or, if installed globally:
ahk init
```

---

## Commands

### `ahk init`

Interactive scaffold. Asks for your project name, description, AI provider, docs path, task adapter, and an optional first task. Creates all harness files in the current directory.

```bash
ahk init

# Skip prompts with flags
ahk init --name "my-app" --provider claude-code --docs ./docs --tasks local
ahk init --name "my-app" --provider codex-cli   --docs ./docs --tasks local
```

Run this once per project. If the project is already initialized, the command prints an 'already initialized' message with suggested next-step commands (`ahk build`, `ahk build --sync`, `ahk reset`, `ahk serve`) and exits without overwriting anything.

The config file extension is chosen automatically: `.ts` if a `tsconfig.json` is present, `.mjs` for ESM-only projects (`"type": "module"` in `package.json`), or `.mjs` otherwise.

---

### `ahk build`

Regenerates `AGENTS.md` and provider-specific files from your `agent-harness-kit.config.ts`. Use this after changing config values.

```bash
ahk build
ahk build --watch    # watch mode: rebuilds automatically on config changes
ahk build --sync     # sync tools: frontmatter in .claude/agents/*.md to match current permission constants
```

---

### `ahk dashboard`

Opens a local web dashboard to visualize everything stored in the harness database — tasks, agent actions, file operations, tool usage, and live timelines. Updates in real time via WebSocket as agents work.

```bash
ahk dashboard                  # opens http://localhost:4242 in your browser
ahk dashboard --port 8080      # custom port
ahk dashboard --no-open        # start server without opening browser
```

If the requested port (default `4242`) is already in use, `ahk dashboard` automatically tries up to 10 sequential ports (e.g. `4242 → 4243 → … → 4251`). The actual port opened is printed to the console. If all 10 ports are exhausted, the command exits with a clear error message showing which port range was attempted.

The dashboard includes:

| View            | What it shows                                                               |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Overview**    | Status counts, active tasks with acceptance progress, recent agent activity |
| **Tasks**       | Full task list, filterable by status, with acceptance progress bars         |
| **Task detail** | Acceptance criteria, action timeline per agent, files touched, tools used   |
| **Agents**      | Per-role breakdown: actions, tasks worked, files touched, completion rate   |
| **Tools**       | Top tools bar chart + full log of recent tool calls with args and results   |
| **Files**       | Most-touched files with operation breakdown + recent file operation log     |

---

### `ahk status`

Shows the current task table and any active agent actions in the terminal.

```bash
ahk status
ahk status --json    # machine-readable output
```

---

### `ahk health`

Runs `health.sh` and reports the result. Exit 0 = healthy, exit 1 = something is wrong.

```bash
ahk health
```

---

### `ahk sync`

Syncs `.harness/feature_list.json` ↔ SQLite. Tasks already in the DB are skipped by slug. Use this to seed the backlog from the JSON file without duplicating existing tasks.

```bash
ahk sync                         # both directions (default)
ahk sync --direction in          # JSON → SQLite only
ahk sync --direction out         # SQLite → JSON only
ahk sync --dry-run               # preview changes without applying them
ahk sync --dry-run --direction in
```

---

### `ahk serve`

Starts the MCP server on stdio. **You never need to call this manually.** After `ahk init`, the generated `.claude/mcp.json` (Claude Code) or `opencode.json` (OpenCode) tells the AI tool to spawn it automatically when you open the project.

```bash
ahk serve
ahk serve --port 3456    # store a port hint in config (stdio transport only)
```

---

### `ahk task add`

Interactively adds a new task to the backlog (SQLite + `feature_list.json`).

```bash
ahk task add
```

---

### `ahk task list`

Lists all tasks. Optionally filter by status.

```bash
ahk task list
ahk task list --status pending
ahk task list --status in_progress
ahk task list --status done
ahk task list --status blocked
ahk task list --json             # machine-readable output
```

---

### `ahk task done <id|slug>`

Marks a task as done. Runs the health check first if health is required — if it fails, the task is not closed.

```bash
ahk task done 3
ahk task done add-auth-flow
```

---

### `ahk reset`

Clears harness data interactively. Only SQLite databases are managed by this command — remote Postgres/MySQL databases are intentionally skipped.

```bash
ahk reset                          # interactive — asks before deleting each item
ahk reset --force                  # skip all confirmation prompts
ahk reset --provider claude-code   # also delete agent files for this provider
ahk reset --provider opencode
ahk reset --provider codex-cli
```

What it can reset:

- The SQLite `.db` file (plus WAL and SHM files if present)
- `.harness/feature_list.json`
- Agent definition files in `.claude/agents/`, `.opencode/agents/`, or `.codex/agents/`

After a reset, run `ahk init` to scaffold a fresh harness.

---

### `ahk migrate`

Migrates provider-specific files from one AI provider to another. Useful when switching from Claude Code to OpenCode or vice versa.

```bash
ahk migrate --to opencode
ahk migrate --to claude-code
ahk migrate --to codex-cli
```

---

### `ahk export`

Exports the full database as JSON or SQL. Useful for backups, external reporting, or migrating data.

```bash
ahk export --json                        # JSON to stdout
ahk export --json --output snapshot.json # JSON to file
ahk export --sql                         # SQL dump to stdout
ahk export --sql --output dump.sql       # SQL dump to file
```

---

## Tasks schema

The `tasks` table includes an `updated_at` timestamp column, set on creation and automatically updated on every status change. On first run after upgrading from an older version, existing rows are backfilled with `COALESCE(completed_at, started_at, created_at)`. Tasks returned by `tasks.get` are ordered by status priority (pending → in_progress → blocked → done) then by `updated_at` descending.

---

## What you can customize

### `agent-harness-kit.config.ts`

Everything in the config file is yours to change:

```ts
import { defineHarness } from '@cardor/agent-harness-kit'

export default defineHarness({
  project: {
    name: 'My App',
    description: 'What this project does',
    docsPath: './docs', // where agents search for documentation
  },

  provider: 'claude-code', // 'claude-code' | 'opencode' | 'codex-cli'

  agents: {
    lead: { instructionsPath: null },
    explorer: { instructionsPath: null, allowedPaths: ['./docs', './src'] },
    builder: { instructionsPath: null, writablePaths: ['./src', './tests'] },
    reviewer: { instructionsPath: null },
    custom: [], // define extra agents here
  },

  // ── Database ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  // SQLite (default — zero native deps, Node 22+ or Bun)
  database: { type: 'sqlite', path: '.harness/harness.db' },

  // PostgreSQL — uncomment to use instead:
  // database: { type: 'postgres', connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL },

  // MySQL — uncomment to use instead:
  // database: { type: 'mysql', connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL },

  storage: {
    dir: '.harness',
    tasks: { adapter: 'local' }, // 'local' | 'jira' | 'linear' | 'mcp'
    sections: {
      toolsUsed: true, // log which tools agents used
      filesModified: true, // log which files were touched
      result: true, // log action results
      blockers: true, // log blockers agents hit
      nextSteps: false, // optional next steps field
    },
    markdownFallback: { enabled: true, path: '.harness/current.md' },
  },

  health: {
    scriptPath: './health.sh',
    required: true, // set to false to skip health checks
  },

  tools: {
    mcp: { enabled: true, port: 3742 },
    scripts: { enabled: true, outputDir: './.harness/scripts' },
  },
})
```

### `health.sh`

This is the most important file to implement. Agents will not start or close tasks until this script exits 0. Examples:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# Check the dev server is up
curl -sf http://localhost:3000/health > /dev/null || exit 1

# Run unit tests
npm test || exit 1

# Check DB connection
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "SELECT 1" > /dev/null 2>&1 || exit 1

echo "All checks passed."
```

### Agent definition files

Created once and **never overwritten** by `ahk build` — your edits are permanent.

**Claude Code** (`.claude/agents/*.md`) and **OpenCode** (`.opencode/agents/*.md`) use Markdown with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: builder
description: Builder agent — implements the plan produced by explorer and lead
tools:
  read: true
  write: true
  edit: true
  bash: true
permissionMode: acceptEdits
---

# Builder Agent

You are the builder agent for MyApp. Follow these rules:

- All API endpoints must be defined in `src/routes/`
- Never modify `src/core/` without lead approval
- Run `npm test` after every change and fix failures before completing
- Use the existing error handling pattern from `src/lib/errors.ts`
```

**Codex CLI** (`.codex/agents/*.toml`) uses TOML format:

```toml
name = "builder"
sandbox_mode = "workspace-write"

description = """
Builder agent — implements the plan produced by explorer and lead.
"""

developer_instructions = """
# Builder Agent

You are the builder agent for MyApp. Follow these rules:

- All API endpoints must be defined in `src/routes/`
- Never modify `src/core/` without lead approval
- Run `npm test` after every change and fix failures before completing
"""
```

The `sandbox_mode` field controls Codex's filesystem permissions per agent: `"read-only"` for lead, explorer, and reviewer; `"workspace-write"` for builder. The `permissionMode` field in Claude Code agent files enforces the same constraints at the session level (`plan` for read-only roles, `acceptEdits` for builder).

### `.harness/feature_list.json`

The human-editable task backlog. Add tasks here, then run `ahk sync` to load them into SQLite.

```json
[
  {
    "slug": "add-auth-flow",
    "title": "Add JWT authentication flow",
    "description": "Implement login, refresh token, and logout endpoints",
    "acceptance": [
      "POST /auth/login returns a signed JWT",
      "POST /auth/refresh validates and rotates the token",
      "All protected routes return 401 without a valid token",
      "Tests cover happy path and token expiry"
    ]
  }
]
```

Good acceptance criteria make the difference — the reviewer agent uses them to decide whether to approve or block a task.

---

## MCP tools (for agents)

The harness exposes these tools via MCP. Agents use them instead of reading files directly.

| Tool                      | Parameters                                      | Description                                                                                                                                                            |

## Agent roles

| Role           | Responsibility                                                                                                                              |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **lead**       | Decomposes the task into a plan, assigns sub-agents. Does not write code or read source files.                                              |
| **explorer**   | Reads and maps the codebase. Never writes files. Records every file read.                                                                   |
| **consultant** | Provides structured technical advisory after explorer. Runs conditionally. Never writes code. Writes advisory to harness via actions.write. |
| **builder**    | Implements the plan. Only writes to `writablePaths`. Records every file modified.                                                           |
| **reviewer**   | Verifies all acceptance criteria are met. Approves or blocks. Runs health check before approving.                                           |

### MCP tool permissions by role

Each agent role has a scoped set of MCP tools enforced through the agent definition files.

| Tool                          | lead | explorer | consultant | builder | reviewer |
| ----------------------------- | :--: | :------: | :--------: | :-----: | :------: |
| `tasks.get`                   |  ✅  |    ✅    |     ✅     |   ✅    |    ✅    |
| `tasks.claim`                 |  ✅  |    ✅    |     ✅     |   ✅    |    ✅    |
| `tasks.add`                   |  ✅  |    ❌    |     ❌     |   ✅    |    ✅    |
| `tasks.update`                |  ✅  |    ❌    |     ❌     |   ✅    |    ✅    |
| `tasks.edit`                  |  ✅  |    ❌    |     ❌     |   ✅    |    ✅    |
| `tasks.archive` / `unarchive` |  ✅  |    ❌    |     ❌     |   ✅    |    ✅    |
| `tasks.acceptance_get`        |  ✅  |    ✅    |     ✅     |   ✅    |    ✅    |
| `tasks.acceptance.update`     |  ❌  |    ❌    |     ❌     |   ❌    |    ✅    |
| `actions.*` (all 6)           |  ✅  |    ✅    |     ✅     |   ✅    |    ✅    |
| `docs.search`                 |  ✅  |    ✅    |     ✅     |   ✅    |    ✅    |
| `permissions.check`           |  ✅  |    ✅    |     ❌     |   ✅    |    ✅    |
| `deps.snapshot`               |  ❌  |    ❌    |     ✅     |   ❌    |    ❌    |
| `deps.check`                  |  ❌  |    ❌    |     ✅     |   ❌    |    ❌    |

**explorer** is read-only for task state — can query but cannot mutate status or mark criteria.  
**reviewer** is the only role that can mark acceptance criteria as met (`tasks.acceptance.update`).  
**lead** and **builder** have identical access, both excluding `tasks.acceptance.update`.  
**consultant** is advisory-only — reads code, writes to harness, and can call deps tools. Never modifies the codebase.

`permissions.check` compares each `.claude/agents/*.md` tool list against the canonical constants in the package. Returns `{ in_sync: bool, agents: { lead, explorer, consultant, builder, reviewer } }` with per-agent `missing` and `extra` arrays. Run `ahk build --sync` to fix any drift.

## What to commit

| File                          | Commit?             |

## Runtime compatibility

| Runtime          | SQLite                         | PostgreSQL                | MySQL                   |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Node.js ≥ 22     | ✅ uses `node:sqlite` built-in | ✅ via `postgres` package | ✅ via `mysql2` package |
| Bun (any recent) | ✅ uses `bun:sqlite` built-in  | ✅ via `postgres` package | ✅ via `mysql2` package |
| Node.js < 22     | ❌ `node:sqlite` not available | ✅                        | ✅                      |

SQLite requires no additional packages. For PostgreSQL install `postgres`, for MySQL install `mysql2`:

```bash
npm install postgres    # for PostgreSQL
npm install mysql2      # for MySQL
```

---

## Contributing & local development

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd agent-harness-kit
npm install

npm run build:ui    # build the dashboard SPA (dashboard/ → src/dashboard-dist/)
npm run build       # build:ui + tsc + copy-assets
npm run dev         # watch mode (CLI TypeScript only)
npm test            # run tests
```

### Testing the local build in another project

Use the helper script to build the package and link it into any local project in one step:

```bash
# Build + link into a specific project
./scripts/link-local.sh /path/to/your-other-project

# Build + register globally only (then link manually wherever you need)
./scripts/link-local.sh
```

What the script does:

1. Runs `npm run build` (full build including dashboard assets)
2. Runs `npm link` to register the package globally on your machine
3. Runs `npm link @cardor/agent-harness-kit` inside the target project
4. Smoke-tests the `ahk` binary with `--version`

After linking, `npx ahk` inside the target project will use your local build. To unlink when you're done:

```bash
# Inside the target project
npm unlink @cardor/agent-harness-kit

# Optionally remove the global registration
npm uninstall -g @cardor/agent-harness-kit
```

> **Tip:** If you're iterating quickly, run `npm run build` in this repo after each change — the link picks up the new `dist/` immediately without re-running the script.

To work on the dashboard UI with hot reload:

```bash
# Terminal 1 — CLI server (no browser open)
cd your-test-project && ahk dashboard --no-open --port 4242

# Terminal 2 — Vite dev server with HMR
cd dashboard && npm run dev   # http://localhost:5173, proxies /api and /ws → :4242
```

Commit messages follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) with a required scope:

```
feat(cli): add export command
fix(db): prevent race condition in claimTask
chore(ci): update Node version to 22
```

Types: `feat fix chore refactor docs test perf style build ci revert`

## Roadmap

- ✅ **`ahk dashboard`** — local web UI with real-time WebSocket updates. Shows tasks, action timelines, file activity, tool usage, and per-agent breakdowns.
- ✅ **`ahk reset`** — interactively clear the SQLite DB, feature list, and agent files to start a project fresh.
- ✅ **PostgreSQL + MySQL drivers** — remote database support via `postgres` and `mysql2` packages. Configure with `database: { type: 'postgres', connectionString: '...' }`.
- ✅ **`actions.record_file` + `actions.record_tool`** — dedicated MCP tools for populating the Files and Tools dashboard views.
- ✅ **`tasks.add` via MCP** — agents can create new tasks on the fly without leaving the conversation.
- ✅ **Global installation** — `ahk init` can install the harness to your home directory, shared across projects.
- ✅ **Input validation** — all CLI prompts validate and retry on bad values.
- ✅ **Codex CLI provider** — full support for OpenAI Codex CLI. Generates `.codex/agents/*.toml` files with proper `sandbox_mode` per role and merges `.codex/config.toml` for MCP registration. Overrides the built-in `default` agent so the harness lead runs by default.
- **Graphify integration** — connect the harness to Graphify to visualize agent workflows, task dependencies, and action timelines as interactive graphs.
- **Open Telemetry integration** — emit OpenTelemetry spans for all agent actions, file operations, and tool calls.
- **Jira task adapter** — pull tasks directly from Jira instead of maintaining `feature_list.json` manually.
- **Linear task adapter** — same as Jira, for Linear.
- **GitHub Issues adapter** — same, for GitHub Issues.
- **Remote MCP adapter** — connect to a hosted MCP server instead of a local SQLite file. Enables shared task state across machines and team members without syncing a DB file.
